# General Rules

- Prefer complete, long-term implementations over workarounds or quick patches.
- Keep existing behavior, routes, and UI intact unless explicitly asked to remove/rename them.
- This repo is a Turborepo + Bun monorepo: use `bun` + root scripts; avoid introducing `npm`/`yarn` workflows.
- Prefer workspace imports (`@proxed/*`) and package entrypoints over deep relative imports across workspaces.
- Next.js apps default to React Server Components; add `"use client"` only when necessary.
- Security: never expose or log secrets (AI provider keys, Supabase keys, tokens). Provider calls should go through `apps/proxy` when applicable.
