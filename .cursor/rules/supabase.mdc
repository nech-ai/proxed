# Postgres SQL Style Guide

## General

- Use lowercase for SQL reserved words to maintain consistency and readability.
- Employ consistent, descriptive identifiers for tables, columns, and other database objects.
- Use white space and indentation to enhance the readability of your code.
- Store dates in ISO 8601 format (`yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sssss`).
- Include comments for complex logic, using '/* ... */' for block comments and '--' for line comments.

## Naming Conventions

- Avoid SQL reserved words and ensure names are unique and under 63 characters.
- Use snake_case for tables and columns.
- Prefer plurals for table names
- Prefer singular names for columns.

## Tables

- Avoid prefixes like 'tbl_' and ensure no table name matches any of its column names.
- Always add an `id` column of type `identity generated always` unless otherwise specified.
- Create all tables in the `public` schema unless otherwise specified.
- Always add the schema to SQL queries for clarity.
- Always add a comment to describe what the table does. The comment can be up to 1024 characters.

## Columns

- Use singular names and avoid generic names like 'id'.
- For references to foreign tables, use the singular of the table name with the `_id` suffix. For example `user_id` to reference the `users` table
- Always use lowercase except in cases involving acronyms or when readability would be enhanced by an exception.

#### Examples:

```sql
create table books (
  id bigint generated always as identity primary key,
  title text not null,
  author_id bigint references authors (id)
);
comment on table books is 'A list of all the books in the library.';
```


## Queries

- When the query is shorter keep it on just a few lines. As it gets larger start adding newlines for readability
- Add spaces for readability.

Smaller queries:


```sql
select *
from employees
where end_date is null;

update employees
set end_date = '2023-12-31'
where employee_id = 1001;
```

Larger queries:

```sql
select
  first_name,
  last_name
from
  employees
where
  start_date between '2021-01-01' and '2021-12-31'
and
  status = 'employed';
```


### Joins and Subqueries

- Format joins and subqueries for clarity, aligning them with related SQL clauses.
- Prefer full table names when referencing tables. This helps for readability.

```sql
select
  employees.employee_name,
  departments.department_name
from
  employees
join
  departments on employees.department_id = departments.department_id
where
  employees.start_date > '2022-01-01';
```

## Aliases

- Use meaningful aliases that reflect the data or transformation applied, and always include the 'as' keyword for clarity.

```sql
select count(*) as total_employees
from employees
where end_date is null;
```


## Complex queries and CTEs

- If a query is extremely complex, prefer a CTE.
- Make sure the CTE is clear and linear. Prefer readability over performance.
- Add comments to each block.

```sql
with department_employees as (
  -- Get all employees and their departments
  select
    employees.department_id,
    employees.first_name,
    employees.last_name,
    departments.department_name
  from
    employees
  join
    departments on employees.department_id = departments.department_id
),
employee_counts as (
  -- Count how many employees in each department
  select
    department_name,
    count(*) as num_employees
  from
    department_employees
  group by
    department_name
)
select
  department_name,
  num_employees
from
  employee_counts
order by
  department_name;
```

# Database: Create functions

You're a Supabase Postgres expert in writing database functions. Generate **high-quality PostgreSQL functions** that adhere to the following best practices:

## General Guidelines

1. **Default to `SECURITY INVOKER`:**

   - Functions should run with the permissions of the user invoking the function, ensuring safer access control.
   - Use `SECURITY DEFINER` only when explicitly required and explain the rationale.

2. **Set the `search_path` Configuration Parameter:**

   - Always set `search_path` to an empty string (`set search_path = '';`).
   - This avoids unexpected behavior and security risks caused by resolving object references in untrusted or unintended schemas.
   - Use fully qualified names (e.g., `schema_name.table_name`) for all database objects referenced within the function.

3. **Adhere to SQL Standards and Validation:**
   - Ensure all queries within the function are valid PostgreSQL SQL queries and compatible with the specified context (ie. Supabase).

## Best Practices

1. **Minimize Side Effects:**

   - Prefer functions that return results over those that modify data unless they serve a specific purpose (e.g., triggers).

2. **Use Explicit Typing:**

   - Clearly specify input and output types, avoiding ambiguous or loosely typed parameters.

3. **Default to Immutable or Stable Functions:**

   - Where possible, declare functions as `IMMUTABLE` or `STABLE` to allow better optimization by PostgreSQL. Use `VOLATILE` only if the function modifies data or has side effects.

4. **Triggers (if Applicable):**
   - If the function is used as a trigger, include a valid `CREATE TRIGGER` statement that attaches the function to the desired table and event (e.g., `BEFORE INSERT`).

## Example Templates

### Simple Function with `SECURITY INVOKER`

```sql
create or replace function my_schema.hello_world()
returns text
language plpgsql
security invoker
set search_path = ''
as $$
begin
  return 'hello world';
end;
$$;
```

### Function with Parameters and Fully Qualified Object Names

```sql
create or replace function public.calculate_total_price(order_id bigint)
returns numeric
language plpgsql
security invoker
set search_path = ''
as $$
declare
  total numeric;
begin
  select sum(price * quantity)
  into total
  from public.order_items
  where order_id = calculate_total_price.order_id;

  return total;
end;
$$;
```

### Function as a Trigger

```sql
create or replace function my_schema.update_updated_at()
returns trigger
language plpgsql
security invoker
set search_path = ''
as $$
begin
  -- Update the "updated_at" column on row modification
  new.updated_at := now();
  return new;
end;
$$;

create trigger update_updated_at_trigger
before update on my_schema.my_table
for each row
execute function my_schema.update_updated_at();
```

### Function with Error Handling

```sql
create or replace function my_schema.safe_divide(numerator numeric, denominator numeric)
returns numeric
language plpgsql
security invoker
set search_path = ''
as $$
begin
  if denominator = 0 then
    raise exception 'Division by zero is not allowed';
  end if;

  return numerator / denominator;
end;
$$;
```

### Immutable Function for Better Optimization

```sql
create or replace function my_schema.full_name(first_name text, last_name text)
returns text
language sql
security invoker
set search_path = ''
immutable
as $$
  select first_name || ' ' || last_name;
$$;
```

# Database: Create migration

You are a Postgres Expert who loves creating secure database schemas.

This project uses the migrations provided by the Supabase CLI.

## Creating a migration file

Given the context of the user's message, create a database migration file inside the folder `supabase/migrations/`.

The file MUST following this naming convention:

The file MUST be named in the format `YYYYMMDDHHmmss_short_description.sql` with proper casing for months, minutes, and seconds in UTC time:

1. `YYYY` - Four digits for the year (e.g., `2024`).
2. `MM` - Two digits for the month (01 to 12).
3. `DD` - Two digits for the day of the month (01 to 31).
4. `HH` - Two digits for the hour in 24-hour format (00 to 23).
5. `mm` - Two digits for the minute (00 to 59).
6. `ss` - Two digits for the second (00 to 59).
7. Add an appropriate description for the migration.

For example:

```
20240906123045_create_profiles.sql
```


## SQL Guidelines

Write Postgres-compatible SQL code for Supabase migration files that:

- Includes a header comment with metadata about the migration, such as the purpose, affected tables/columns, and any special considerations.
- Includes thorough comments explaining the purpose and expected behavior of each migration step.
- Write all SQL in lowercase.
- Add copious comments for any destructive SQL commands, including truncating, dropping, or column alterations.
- When creating a new table, you MUST enable Row Level Security (RLS) even if the table is intended for public access.
- When creating RLS Policies
  - Ensure the policies cover all relevant access scenarios (e.g. select, insert, update, delete) based on the table's purpose and data sensitivity.
  - If the table  is intended for public access the policy can simply return `true`.
  - RLS Policies should be granular: one policy for `select`, one for `insert` etc) and for each supabase role (`anon` and `authenticated`). DO NOT combine Policies even if the functionality is the same for both roles.
  - Include comments explaining the rationale and intended behavior of each security policy

The generated SQL code should be production-ready, well-documented, and aligned with Supabase's best practices.
