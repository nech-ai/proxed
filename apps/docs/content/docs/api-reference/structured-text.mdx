# Text Analysis (`/v1/text`)

The Text Analysis endpoint allows you to submit a string of text and receive a structured JSON response based on the schema defined in your project settings. This is useful for tasks like sentiment analysis, entity extraction, text classification, or summarizing text according to a predefined format.

## Endpoint

*   `POST /v1/text`
*   `POST /v1/text/{projectId}`

If `{projectId}` is provided in the URL, it takes precedence over the `x-project-id` header.

## Authentication

Requires authentication. See the [API Authentication guide](/docs/authentication).

## Headers

*   `Authorization: Bearer {your-partial-api-key}.{your-token}` (Recommended method)
*   `Content-Type: application/json`
*   `x-project-id: {your-project-id}` (Required if projectId is not in the URL path)
*   `x-ai-key: {your-partial-api-key}` (If using non-Bearer token auth methods that require it)
*   `x-device-token: {your-device-token}` (If using legacy device token header auth)

## Request Body

```json
{
  "text": "<string-to-be-analyzed>"
}
```

*   `text` (string, required): The raw text string to be analyzed.

## Successful Response (200 OK)

The response will be a JSON object whose structure is determined by the **output schema** you have configured for this project in the Proxed.AI dashboard (under Project Settings -> Schema Builder).

**Example (assuming a schema for sentiment analysis):**

```json
{
  "sentiment": "positive",
  "confidence": 0.98,
  "keywords": ["great service", "friendly staff"]
}
```

## Error Responses

Refer to the [API Errors guide](/docs/api-errors) for details on error codes and messages.
Common errors include:
*   `UNAUTHORIZED`: Authentication failure.
*   `PROJECT_NOT_FOUND`: The specified project ID is invalid.
*   `BAD_REQUEST`: Invalid JSON payload or missing `text` field.
*   `VALIDATION_ERROR`: The project schema is invalid.
*   `PROVIDER_ERROR`: An error occurred with the underlying AI language model.

## Example Request (curl)

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://api.proxed.ai/v1/text/{your-project-id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {your-partial-api-key}.{your-device-token-or-test-key}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "text": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. I loved the customer service, it was excellent!"
  }'
```
