# Text Analysis (`/v1/text`)

The Text Analysis endpoint allows you to submit a string of text and receive a structured JSON response based on the schema defined in your project settings. This is useful for tasks like sentiment analysis, entity extraction, text classification, or summarizing text according to a predefined format.

## Endpoint

*   `POST /v1/text`
*   `POST /v1/text/{projectId}`

If `{projectId}` is provided in the URL, it takes precedence over the `x-project-id` header.

## Authentication

Requires authentication. See the [API Authentication guide](/docs/authentication).

## Headers

*   `Authorization: Bearer {your-partial-api-key}.{your-token}` (Recommended method)
*   `Content-Type: application/json`
*   `x-project-id: {your-project-id}` (Required if projectId is not in the URL path)
*   `x-ai-key: {your-partial-api-key}` (If using non-Bearer token auth methods that require it)
*   `x-device-token: {your-device-token}` (If using legacy device token header auth)

## Request Body

```json
{
  "text": "<string-to-be-analyzed>"
}
```

*   `text` (string, required): The raw text string to be analyzed.

## Successful Response (200 OK)

The response will be a JSON object whose structure is determined by the **output schema** you have configured for this project in the Proxed.AI dashboard (under Project Settings -> Schema Builder).

**Example (assuming a schema for sentiment analysis):**

```json
{
  "sentiment": "positive",
  "confidence": 0.98,
  "keywords": ["great service", "friendly staff"]
}
```

## Supported Providers and Models

Proxed.AI supports structured text analysis with models from all major providers:

*   **OpenAI**: `gpt-5.2`, `gpt-5`, `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`
*   **Anthropic**: `claude-sonnet-4-5`, `claude-opus-4-5`, `claude-sonnet-4-0`

The system automatically selects an appropriate model based on your project's provider, or you can specify a custom model in your project settings.

## Error Responses

Common errors include:
*   `UNAUTHORIZED`: Authentication failure.
*   `PROJECT_NOT_FOUND`: The specified project ID is invalid.
*   `BAD_REQUEST`: Invalid JSON payload or missing `text` field.
*   `VALIDATION_ERROR`: The project schema is invalid.
