# Partial Keys

Partial keys are a security mechanism that protects your API keys by splitting them into two separate parts: a server part stored securely on your servers, and a client part that users must provide. This approach significantly enhances security by ensuring that no single location contains the complete API key.

## Understanding Partial Keys

Partial keys work by:
- Splitting your original API key into two cryptographically linked parts
- Storing the server part in your secure database
- Providing the client part to your users or applications
- Requiring both parts to be present to reconstruct the original API key
- Adding a validation layer to ensure the reconstructed key is legitimate

When an API request is made, the system combines both parts, validates the reconstructed key, and then uses it to authenticate the request to the third-party API provider.

## Why Use Partial Keys

Partial keys provide several security advantages:

- **Reduced Risk of Key Exposure**: Even if your database is compromised, attackers only get the server part, which is unusable alone
- **Enhanced Access Control**: Require users to provide their client part for each request, allowing fine-grained access control
- **Audit Trail**: Track which client parts are used for which requests
- **Revocation Control**: Easily revoke access by invalidating specific client parts without changing the original API key
- **Key Management**: Manage multiple API keys with different access levels using the same underlying provider key

## Step 1: Create a Partial Key

1. Navigate to the [API Keys management page](https://app.proxed.ai/settings/team/keys) in your Proxed.AI account.

2. Click "Add New Key" to create a new partial key.

3. Enter a descriptive name for your key.

4. Select the API provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).

5. Paste your complete original API key in the "API Key" field.

6. Click "Create Partial Key".

7. The system will generate your partial key and display the client part. **Important:** Copy this client part immediately as it will only be shown once.

## Step 2: Using Partial Keys in Your Applications

To use partial keys in your applications, you'll need to:

1. Store the client part securely in your application.

2. Include the client part in your API requests to Proxed.AI.

## Technical Details

Partial keys use a secure splitting mechanism with these characteristics:

- A random salt is generated and attached to both key parts to ensure they match
- The splitting point is chosen randomly for each key to prevent pattern analysis
- Metadata stored with the client part includes version, timestamp, and unique identifiers
- The original API key format is preserved and validated when reassembled

## Using Partial Keys with Swift

When integrating partial keys in your iOS applications, you can combine them with Apple's DeviceCheck for enhanced security:

```swift
import OpenAI
import DeviceCheck

actor OpenAIAnalyzer {
    let endpoint = "https://api.proxed.ai/v1/openai/<your-project-id>"
    let apiKey = "<your-api-key>"
    let client: OpenAI

    init() async {
        let token = await DeviceCheck.retrieveToken()
        let combinedToken = "\(apiKey).\(token ?? "")"

        let configuration = OpenAI.Configuration(
            baseURL: URL(string: endpoint)!,
            apiKey: combinedToken
        )

        client = OpenAI(configuration: configuration)
    }

    func generateCompletion(messages: [Chat]) async throws -> ChatCompletion {
        let query = ChatQuery(
            model: .gpt4,
            messages: messages
        )
        return try await client.chats(query: query)
    }
}
```

## Managing Partial Keys

In the Proxed.AI dashboard, you can:

- View all your partial keys
- Create new partial keys
- Delete existing partial keys
- Monitor usage of each partial key
- Set rate limits and permissions per key

## Troubleshooting

If you experience issues with your partial keys:

- **Invalid Key Error**: Ensure you're using the correct client part that matches the server part
- **Missing Client Part**: Unfortunately, if you lose the client part, you'll need to create a new partial key
- **Key Validation Errors**: Check that your original API key is still valid with your provider
- **Format Not Recognized**: Ensure your API key is from a supported provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

For additional assistance, contact the Proxed.AI support team.

## Security Best Practices

For optimal security when using partial keys:

- Store client parts in environment variables, not in code repositories
- Rotate partial keys periodically
- Use different partial keys for different environments (development, staging, production)
- Set the minimum necessary permissions for each partial key
- Monitor usage patterns to detect potential abuse
