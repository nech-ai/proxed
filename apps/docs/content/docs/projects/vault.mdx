# Vault for Generated Images

Vault is a secure, private library for generated images. When enabled on a project, every image produced by the Image Generation API is stored in Supabase Storage and appears in both the execution details and the Vault page.

## Enable Vault for a project

1. Open the project in the Proxed.AI dashboard.
2. In the **Image Generation** section, toggle **Save images to Vault**.

Once enabled, new images generated for that project are automatically saved.

## What gets saved

When Vault is enabled, Proxed stores:

- The image file in the private `vault` bucket.
- Metadata such as project, execution, mime type, size, and timestamps.

Object paths follow this pattern:

```
team-id/generated-images/<project-id>/YYYY/MM/DD/<uuid>.<ext>
```

## API response changes

When Vault is enabled, each image includes a signed `url` and its `path` in addition to the base64 payload.

```json
{
  "images": [
    {
      "base64": "iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUg...",
      "mediaType": "image/png",
      "url": "https://...signed-url...",
      "path": "team-id/generated-images/project-id/2025/12/30/uuid.png"
    }
  ]
}
```

Signed URLs are short-lived to keep Vault private. Use `path` to request a fresh signed URL when needed.

## Viewing in the dashboard

- **Execution details** show a grid of saved images for that run.
- **Vault** shows all saved images across projects in a single grid.

Vault supports search, project filtering, and date range filtering. Each image includes actions to open, download, or delete.

## Permissions

- Team members can view Vault items for their team.
- Only team owners can delete items from Vault.

## Self-hosting notes

If you self-host Proxed.AI:

- Run the latest Supabase migrations.
- Ensure the `vault` storage bucket and policies are applied.

This keeps Vault private and scoped to team membership.
