# `apps/web` (`@proxed/web`)

Marketing/landing site built with Next.js App Router.

## Entry points

- Routes: `apps/web/src/app/*`
- Page sections: `apps/web/src/components/sections/*`
- MDX rendering: `apps/web/src/components/mdx.tsx`
- Content loaders: `apps/web/src/lib/*`

## Conventions

- Prefer Server Components by default; use `"use client"` only for interactive/animated pieces.
- Keep copy/content changes localized to the section/page; avoid cross-cutting refactors for content tweaks.
- Reuse `@proxed/ui` primitives where it fits, but keep the marketing UI lightweight.
