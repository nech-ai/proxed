---

We're excited to announce the formal start of the Proxed.AI project!

Our core mission is to address the complexities and security concerns developers face when integrating AI models into iOS applications. Proxed.AI is envisioned as an open-source, secure gateway for AI calls on iOS.

### Initial Focus & Core Concepts:

*   **Secure Key Management:** Designing a robust system to protect API keys from client-side exposure.
*   **DeviceCheck Integration:** Leveraging Apple's DeviceCheck to verify genuine iOS devices and prevent unauthorized requests.
*   **Structured Responses:** Enabling developers to define schemas for predictable and validated AI outputs.
*   **Usage Tracking:** Providing tools to monitor API usage for cost management and performance optimization.

Proxed.AI will be developed as an open-source platform. You can follow our progress and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/nech-ai/proxed).

This marks the beginning of our efforts to build a comprehensive solution for secure and efficient AI integration on iOS.
