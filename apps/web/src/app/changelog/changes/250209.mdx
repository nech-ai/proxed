---

Today we're detailing the core Proxed.AI solution, designed to offer a simplified and secure way to integrate AI APIs into your iOS applications.

### Key Architectural Highlights:

*   **Secure API Gateway:** Proxed.AI acts as a managed (or self-hostable) proxy, meaning your app calls our endpoints, not AI providers directly.
*   **Split-Key Management:** We employ a split-key approach where provider API keys are divided. A client-side partial key is used by your app, and the complementary server-side part is stored securely by Proxed. Full keys are only momentarily reconstructed during request processing, never fully stored in one place accessible from the client.
*   **Built-in DeviceCheck Verification:** Every request routed through Proxed.AI undergoes automatic DeviceCheck token validation with Apple's servers, ensuring calls originate from legitimate instances of your app on genuine iOS devices.
*   **Additional Safety Features:** The platform is built with rate limiting, usage tracking, and cost monitoring capabilities in mind.

Our aim is to provide an easy-to-integrate solution that handles complex security measures like DeviceCheck and secure key management, allowing developers to focus on building features.
