We're excited to roll out the **Visual Schema Builder**, a powerful new tool within the Proxed.AI dashboard designed to make working with structured LLM responses more intuitive and efficient.

### Key Capabilities:

*   **Visual Schema Design:** Utilize a drag-and-drop interface to construct your desired LLM response schemas.
*   **Import & Export:** Seamlessly import existing schemas (e.g., from JSON examples or Zod code) and export ready-to-use validation code (Zod schemas, Swift structs).
*   **Real-time Validation:** Get instant feedback, type checking, and validation for required fields and custom rules as you design.
*   **Code Generation:** Automatically generate Zod schemas for runtime validation and Swift structs for your iOS client applications.
*   **Advanced Features:** Support for nested objects, arrays, enums, optional fields, default values, and custom descriptions to guide the LLM.

This tool aims to simplify the process of ensuring your AI model outputs are predictable, reliable, and easily integrable into your applications.
