We've shipped a significantly improved onboarding experience and enhanced our documentation to make getting started with Proxed.AI smoother and more intuitive.

### Key Improvements:

*   **Guided Onboarding Flow:** A new linear, step-by-step process guides you through:
    *   Quick team creation.
    *   Simplified member invitations with role selection.
    *   Visual guides for DeviceCheck credential setup.
    *   Smarter partial key detection and secure client-side splitting.
*   **Simplified DeviceCheck Configuration:** Visual explanations, inline documentation for Apple credentials, and better error messaging.
*   **Improved Partial Key Management:** Auto-detection of key types, one-time secure client-side splitting, and clearer visuals.
*   **Contextual Documentation:** UI components now link directly to relevant documentation sections (e.g., [Partial Keys](https://docs.proxed.ai/partial-keys), [DeviceCheck](https://docs.proxed.ai/device-check)).

These changes are aimed at reducing friction and helping you securely integrate AI into your iOS apps more quickly.
