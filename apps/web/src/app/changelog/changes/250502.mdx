To help you better monitor API usage and manage costs, we're introducing **Configurable Consumption Notifications** for your projects.

### Key Features:

*   **Custom Thresholds:** Define specific API call volume thresholds that trigger an alert.
*   **Time Intervals:** Set the time window (e.g., 5 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day) over which these calls are counted.
*   **Email Alerts:** Receive notifications (initially via email) when your project exceeds its configured threshold within the defined interval.
*   **Alert Fatigue Prevention:** Once a notification is sent, another won't be triggered for the same project until the defined time interval has passed, even if high usage continues.

### Benefits:

*   **Cost Management:** Get early warnings of high usage to investigate and prevent unexpected cost escalations.
*   **Abuse Detection:** Identify potential compromises or misuse indicated by sudden usage spikes.
*   **Performance Insights:** Gain insights into your app's API consumption patterns.

Configure these notifications in your Project Settings within the Proxed.AI dashboard to define what constitutes high consumption for your specific application needs.
