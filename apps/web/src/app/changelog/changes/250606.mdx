title: "Major Proxy Engine Upgrade: Enhanced Reliability, Security & Observability"
publishedAt: "2025-06-06"
summary: "The core API proxy has been rebuilt for improved resilience with automatic retries, better security with advanced request validation, and deeper observability with new metrics."

We've rolled out a significant overhaul of our core proxy engine, making it more robust, secure, and observable. These updates are now live for all self-hosted instances and are being deployed to our hosted infrastructure.

### Key Enhancements:

*   **Increased Resilience**:
    *   The proxy now automatically retries failed requests from transient errors (e.g., `429`, `502`, `503`) using an exponential backoff strategy.
    *   Requests have configurable timeouts to prevent them from hanging.

*   **Advanced Security**:
    *   We've implemented stricter sanitization of both request and response headers to block sensitive information and prevent potential vulnerabilities.
    *   Request validation has been enhanced to protect against issues like HTTP request smuggling.

*   **Improved Observability**:
    *   A new internal metrics collection system tracks request counts, error rates, and latency histograms, providing better insight into performance.

*   **Centralized & Future-Proofed Configuration**:
    *   All AI provider-specific settings are now managed in a centralized, type-safe configuration, making the system easier to maintain and extend.

These foundational improvements enhance the reliability and security of all requests proxied through Proxed.AI and pave the way for our upcoming global multi-region hosting for lower latency worldwide.
