We're excited to announce that **Google AI (Gemini) is now fully supported** by Proxed.AI! You can now proxy requests to Google's powerful Gemini models with the same enterprise-grade security and features you've come to expect.

### What's New:

*   **Complete Google AI Integration**: Route all your Gemini API calls through Proxed.AI's secure gateway
*   **Latest Gemini Models**: Support for Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash, 2.0 series, 1.5 series, and more
*   **Unified Security**: Same DeviceCheck verification and partial key system for your Google AI keys
*   **Structured Responses**: Full support for text, vision, and PDF analysis with schema validation
*   **Transparent Pricing**: Accurate cost tracking based on Google's official pricing tiers

### Supported Models:

*   **Gemini 2.5 Series**: `gemini-2.5-pro` (state-of-the-art), `gemini-2.5-flash` (best price-performance)
*   **Gemini 2.0 Series**: `gemini-2.0-flash`, `gemini-2.0-flash-lite`
*   **Gemini 1.5 Series**: `gemini-1.5-pro`, `gemini-1.5-flash`, `gemini-1.5-flash-8b`
*   **Specialized Models**: Vision models, embedding models, and more

### API Endpoints:

Route your Google AI requests through:
```
https://api.proxed.ai/v1/google/{projectId}/{googleApiPath}
```

For example:
```
https://api.proxed.ai/v1/google/your-project-id/models/gemini-pro:generateContent
```

### Getting Started:

1. Add your Google AI API key to your Proxed account
2. Create or update a project to use the Google provider
3. Use the same authentication methods (Bearer token, DeviceCheck)
4. Start making secure requests to Gemini models!

This brings our supported providers to three major AI platforms, giving you more flexibility and choice while maintaining consistent security across all your AI integrations.
