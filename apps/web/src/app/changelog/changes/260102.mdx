title: "Streaming Usage Finalization + Public Model Lists"
publishedAt: "2026-01-02"
summary: "Execution usage now finalizes after streams end, model lists are publicly accessible, and dashboard execution views include pricing + model metadata."
---

We shipped a set of proxy + dashboard improvements focused on usage accuracy and SDK compatibility:

### Streaming usage finalization

- Streaming responses now update execution usage **after the stream ends**, so token counts, finish reasons, and costs are complete.
- Provider-specific stream usage parsing for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google is now consistent.
- Added a toggle to disable storing stream summaries: set `STREAM_STORE_SUMMARY=false`.

### Public model list endpoints

Model list endpoints are now **public** to match SDK discovery behavior (no auth header required):

- `GET /v1/openai/models`
- `GET /v1/openai/{projectId}/models`
- `GET /v1/anthropic/models`
- `GET /v1/anthropic/{projectId}/models`
- `GET /v1/google/models`
- `GET /v1/google/{projectId}/models`

These return Proxed-supported models with display names and pricing metadata.

### Dashboard execution details

- Execution tables and details now show model display names and pricing badges.
- Filters and model selectors are more responsive with reduced recomputation.
