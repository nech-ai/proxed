We're excited to announce a significant upgrade to our core infrastructure: Proxed.AI has been fully migrated to the AI SDK v5. This move allows us to leverage the latest advancements in AI development tooling, bringing improved performance, stronger security, and a better developer experience to our platform.

<br />
### Why Upgrade to AI SDK v5?

The AI SDK v5 is a major step forward, introducing significant improvements in type safety, consistency, and overall performance. By upgrading, we are able to:

- **Enhance Type Safety**: The new version provides more robust type definitions, reducing the chance of runtime errors and making integrations more reliable.
- **Improve Performance**: AI SDK v5 includes optimizations that lead to faster response times and more efficient processing of AI requests.
- **Standardize the Developer Experience**: The updated SDK offers a more consistent and intuitive API, which simplifies our internal development and will make it easier to add new features in the future.

This migration touches every part of our system, from how we handle [structured responses](/updates/structured-routes) for text, vision, and PDF analysis to the way we manage [API authentication](/updates/api-authentication-explained).

<br />
### What This Means for You

While this is primarily an internal infrastructure upgrade, you'll experience the benefits through:

1.  **Faster and More Reliable Responses**: The performance improvements in AI SDK v5 mean your requests will be processed more quickly and with greater stability.
2.  **More Consistent API Behavior**: The updated, standardized APIs will lead to more predictable behavior across all supported providers, including [OpenAI](/updates/public-launch), [Anthropic](/updates/public-launch), and [Google AI](/updates/google-ai-integration).
3.  **Future-Proofing**: By staying on the cutting edge of AI tooling, we ensure that Proxed.AI can quickly adopt new features and capabilities as they are released.

The core principles of our platform remain the same. We are still committed to providing top-tier security through our [split-key architecture and DeviceCheck integration](/updates/token-generation), and our platform is still fully [open-source](https://github.com/nech-ai/proxed) for those who wish to [self-host](/updates/our-pricing-philosophy).

<br />
### Under the Hood: Key Migration Changes

For those interested in the technical details, the migration involved several key changes:

- **Package Updates**: We've moved from stable versions of the AI SDK to the latest `5.0.0-beta` releases across all our packages to ensure full compatibility.
- **API Client Refactoring**: We've updated our internal AI client to use the new provider patterns introduced in v5.
- **Modernized API Calls**: We refactored our `generateObject` calls for structured data extraction to align with the new, more streamlined v5 syntax. This affects our text, vision, and PDF analysis routes.
- **Updated Token Usage Tracking**: The way token usage is reported by the SDK has changed. We've updated our metrics and cost-tracking systems to use the new `inputTokens` and `outputTokens` properties, ensuring our [consumption notifications](/updates/consumption-notifications) and analytics remain accurate.

These changes are designed to be seamless. Your existing integrations will continue to work without any modifications on your end.

<br />
### The Road Ahead

This migration to AI SDK v5 is a foundational step that prepares us for the exciting features on our [roadmap](/updates/proxed-ai-roadmap). With a more powerful and flexible core, we can accelerate the development of:

-   Advanced rate limiting and cost controls.
-   Deeper multi-provider support and smart routing.
-   Enhanced monitoring and analytics.

We're committed to providing the most secure and developer-friendly platform for integrating AI into your iOS apps. This upgrade is a testament to that commitment.

As always, you can follow our progress on [GitHub](https://github.com/nech-ai/proxed) and check out our [documentation](https://docs.proxed.ai) for more details on our security and integration patterns.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to build upon this new foundation!
