Beyond the basic DeviceCheck implementation, there are several critical practices you should follow to ensure your API keys remain secure. Let's explore these essential security measures.

<br />
### Never Embed Plain API Keys in the App

This is rule #1 of mobile app security:
- Don't hardcode API keys in your app's binary
- Attackers can easily decompile apps and extract keys
- If you need a client-side identifier, use:
  - A less-privileged token
  - A project ID that maps to the real key on your server
  - Time-limited tokens generated by your backend

<br />
### Use a Secure Backend Proxy

Your mobile app should be a thin client:
- Route all API calls through your secure server
- Keep real API keys on the server
- Never let keys leave your control
- Let your server handle sensitive operations
- Enforce rate limits and authorization checks

<br />
### Employ Device Attestation

Use platform-specific verification services:
- iOS: DeviceCheck or App Attest
- Android: Play Integrity API or SafetyNet
- These provide cryptographic proof of app authenticity
- Ensure API keys are only used by genuine app instances
- Verify the environment is trusted

<br />
### Secure Communications

Protect data in transit:
- Always use HTTPS for network calls
- Implement certificate pinning:
  - App only trusts your server's certificate
  - Prevents MITM attacks with fake certificates
  - Be careful with cert updates to avoid breaking the app
- Validate all server responses
- Use secure protocols and current best practices

<br />
### Limit API Key Scope and Permissions

Minimize potential damage:
- Use restrictive API keys when possible
- Limit access to specific endpoints
- Set usage caps and rate limits
- Restrict to specific origins/IPs
- Create separate keys for different functions
- Follow the principle of least privilege

<br />
### Monitor Usage and Rotate Keys

Stay vigilant:
- Track API usage patterns
- Set up alerts for:
  - Sudden usage spikes
  - Abnormal patterns
  - Geographic anomalies
  - Rate limit violations
- Rotate keys periodically
- Have a plan for emergency key rotation
- Keep logs for forensic analysis

<br />
### Store Keys Securely Server-Side

Don't forget server security:
- Use environment variables or secure vaults
- Never store keys in code or version control
- Limit access to keys based on roles
- Protect server endpoints:
  - Require proper authentication
  - Validate all inputs
  - Rate limit requests
  - Log access attempts

<br />
### Defense in Depth

Remember, security is about layers:
- Each measure adds protection
- Multiple barriers slow attackers
- Monitoring catches breaches early
- Quick response limits damage
- Regular audits find weaknesses
