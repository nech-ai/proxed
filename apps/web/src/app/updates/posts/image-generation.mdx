We're introducing a new experimental Image Generation API that lets you create images from text prompts through the same secure, metered proxy you use for text, vision, and PDF.

### What you get
- Works with **OpenAI** (`gpt-image-1`, `dall-e-3`, `dall-e-2`) and **Google AI** (`imagen-3.0-generate-002`).
- Simple endpoint: `POST /v1/image` (or `/v1/image/{projectId}`).
- Supports `size` (e.g., `1024x1024`) or `aspectRatio` (e.g., `16:9`), `n` images, `seed`, and provider-specific options.
- Responses include base64-encoded images plus provider metadata and warnings when available.

### Quick start
Send a request with your project auth headers:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://api.proxed.ai/v1/image/{your-project-id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {your-partial-api-key}.{your-device-token-or-test-key}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "A retro-futuristic city skyline at dusk",
    "model": "gpt-image-1",
    "size": "1024x1024"
  }'
```
