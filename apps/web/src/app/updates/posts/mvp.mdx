The MVP of Nech is here!

I'm excited to share that the MVP of Nech is almost ready. This marks a significant milestone in the development of our platform.

The MVP includes the following features:

- Core platform architecture
- Team management and authentication
- Basic collaboration features

Users can now create teams, invite members, and start collaborating on prompts.

Also, create credentials for multiple providers.

Everything is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nech-ai/nech).

Huge thanks to Vercel and their [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/) for making this possible and [midday.ai](https://midday.ai) for inspiration and huge open knowledge base.

Also, a little demo of comming mobile app:
