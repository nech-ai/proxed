Last week we shipped a completely rebuilt onboarding experience. Here's what's new and why we made these changes.

<br />
### The Problem

Setting up security for AI integrations has been unnecessarily complex. We kept seeing users struggle with the same issues:

- Confused about where to start and what order to do things
- Getting stuck during DeviceCheck configuration
- Losing track of partial keys after creation
- Missing important security steps

<br />
### What's New

We've created a linear, guided flow that walks you through each setup step:

1. **Team creation** → Just enter a name (that's it)
2. **Member invites** → Add your colleagues with proper roles from day one
3. **DeviceCheck setup** → Visual guide for Apple Developer credentials
4. **Partial keys** → Smart key detection and safe client-side splitting

Each component works well on its own but forms a complete security system when combined.

<br />
### Team Creation & Invites

The new team form is minimal - just enter a name and go. For invites, we added:
- Multi-member invitations in one go (no more one-by-one)
- Inline role selection (Owner/Member)
- Email validation that catches common mistakes

<br />
### DeviceCheck Made Simple

Configuring DeviceCheck used to require reading through pages of docs. Now:
- Visual field explanations with tooltips
- Inline documentation about Apple's credentials
- Proper p8 file handling with validation
- Smart error messages that tell you exactly what's wrong

<br />
### Better Partial Key Management

The key management interface got major improvements:
- Auto-detection of key type (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- One-time secure key splitting that happens client-side
- Clear visuals showing which part is stored where
- Copy protection for client parts with confirmation

<br />
### Docs That Actually Help

Instead of generic documentation, we created specific guides:
- [Partial Keys](https://docs.proxed.ai/partial-keys) - What they are, how they work
- [DeviceCheck](https://docs.proxed.ai/device-check) - Step-by-step setup with screenshots

Each component in the UI links directly to relevant documentation sections.

<br />
### What's Next

We're focused on improving these specific areas next:

- Usage notifications and alerts
- Better usage analytics with cost forecasting
- Real-time logging and monitoring of API requests
