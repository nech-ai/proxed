At Proxed.AI, we believe in transparency and providing value, whether you choose our managed service or decide to host our platform yourself. This post outlines our pricing philosophy, explaining our hosted plans, the generous free trial, and why being open-source is central to our approach.

<br />
### Our Hosted Plans: Secure and Scalable

For those who want to get up and running quickly without managing infrastructure, we offer several [hosted plans](https://proxed.ai/#pricing) tailored to different needs, from indie developers to growing businesses:

*   **Starter**: Perfect for getting your initial projects off the ground with essential security features.
*   **Pro**: Ideal for production applications requiring higher capacity and advanced rate-limiting.
*   **Ultimate**: Enterprise-grade security and analytics for high-volume applications.

Each of these plans is designed to provide robust security, including DeviceCheck integration, partial key management, and access to our Visual Schema Builder, with clear, predictable costs.

<br />
### Try Before You Buy: 14-Day Free Trial

We want you to experience the full power and convenience of Proxed.AI's hosted service with no strings attached. That's why **all our hosted plans come with a 14-day free trial**.

*   **No credit card required to start.**
*   Access all features of the selected plan.
*   Seamlessly transition to a paid plan if you choose to continue.

This trial period allows you to integrate Proxed.AI into your iOS apps, test its capabilities, and see the benefits firsthand before making any commitment.

### Why No "Free" Hosted Tier? The Power of Open Source

You might notice we don't offer a perpetually "free" hosted tier, and there's a very important reason for this: **Proxed.AI is proudly [open-source](https://github.com/nech-ai/proxed)**.

Instead of a limited free hosted plan, we offer something much more powerful: the ability to **self-host Proxed.AI on your own infrastructure, completely free, forever, with no usage limits imposed by us.**

This approach aligns with our core beliefs:

1.  **Empowerment**: We provide you with the full codebase. You have complete control over your data, your security, and your setup.
2.  **Transparency**: Our development happens in the open. You can inspect the code, understand how it works, and even contribute.
3.  **No Vendor Lock-In**: If our hosted plans don't fit your needs, or if you require a custom deployment for privacy or compliance reasons, you always have the option to self-host.
4.  **Community Driven**: An open-source model fosters a community that can help improve the product for everyone.

Our hosted plans are for users who prefer the convenience, managed updates, and support that come with a SaaS offering. The revenue from these plans helps fund the ongoing development and maintenance of the open-source project, benefiting all users.

<br />
### Choose Your Path

With Proxed.AI, you have clear choices:

*   **Opt for a Hosted Plan**: Enjoy a managed, secure, and scalable solution with a 14-day free trial to get started.
*   **Self-Host**: Take full control by deploying Proxed.AI on your own servers, free of charge and without limitations.

We believe this model offers the best of both worlds: professional, supported services for those who want them, and ultimate freedom for those who prefer to manage their own stack.
