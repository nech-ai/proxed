Proxed.AI was born from a need to simplify and secure AI integration for iOS developers. We've laid a strong foundation with features like [robust DeviceCheck integration](https://proxed.ai/updates/devicecheck-security), [secure partial key management](https://docs.proxed.ai/partial-keys), and the intuitive [Visual Schema Builder](https://proxed.ai/updates/visual-bulder) for structured LLM responses.

But our journey is far from over! We're constantly listening to your feedback and looking for ways to make Proxed.AI even more powerful, secure, and indispensable. Today, we're excited to share a glimpse into our roadmap and the key areas we're focusing on next.

<br />
### Core Themes for Future Development

Our upcoming features revolve around these central themes:

*   **Enhanced Monitoring & Cost Control**: Giving you complete visibility and control over your AI API usage and spending.
*   **Deeper Security & Compliance**: Continuously raising the bar for protecting your keys and data.
*   **Greater Flexibility & Developer Experience**: Making Proxed.AI even easier and more adaptable to your workflows.
*   **Expanded Provider & Platform Support**: Broadening the reach and capabilities of your AI integrations.

<br />
### Exciting Features on the Horizon

Here's what you can look forward to:

#### 1. Advanced Consumption Alerts & Monitoring

Building on our [initial consumption notifications](https://proxed.ai/updates/consumption-notifications), we're planning:

*   **More Notification Channels**: Beyond email, get alerts via Slack, Webhooks, and more.
*   **Cost-Based Alerts**: Set budget thresholds and get notified based on estimated spending, not just call volume.
*   **Granular Controls**: Fine-tune notification frequency, set "snooze" periods, and customize alert conditions.
*   **Dashboard Integration**: A richer analytics dashboard with real-time logging, detailed request insights, and better cost forecasting.

#### 2. Robust Rate Limiting & Cost Ceilings

To give you finer-grained control and prevent unexpected bills:

*   **Server-Side Rate Limits**: Configure granular rate limits per project, per API key, and potentially per end-user identifier.
*   **Hard & Soft Cost Ceilings**: Set strict spending limits that automatically halt requests or trigger warnings when approached.

#### 3. Expanded Multi-Provider Support

We want Proxed.AI to be your universal AI gateway:

*   **Seamless Switching**: Easily switch between different AI providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) using the same Proxed.AI endpoint and configuration.
*   **A/B Testing**: Potentially facilitate A/B testing of different models or providers for the same task.
*   **Unified Configuration**: Manage provider-specific parameters and authentication through a consistent Proxed.AI interface.

#### 4. Enhanced Schema & Validation Capabilities

Taking structured responses to the next level:

*   **Advanced Validation Rules**: More sophisticated custom validation rules directly within the Visual Schema Builder or via code imports.
*   **Deeper Type Support**: Support for a wider range of Zod and Swift data types and schema constructs.

#### 5. Enterprise-Focused Features

For larger teams and more complex security needs:

*   **Comprehensive Audit Logs**: Detailed logging of administrative actions, configuration changes, and key management events.
*   **Enhanced Team Roles & Permissions**: More granular control over team member access and capabilities.
*   **Potential for SSO/Advanced User Management**: Streamlining access for larger organizations.
