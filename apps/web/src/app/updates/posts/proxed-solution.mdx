Implementing an API proxy with DeviceCheck from scratch can be complex. That's why we built Proxed.AI â€” an open-source iOS SDK and cloud service that acts as a secure gateway for AI calls. Let's explore how it simplifies the process while maintaining robust security.

<br />
### What is Proxed.AI?

Instead of building your own backend from scratch, you can leverage our managed proxy (or host it yourself) which is built with key security in mind. Our solution provides:
- Ready-made secure proxy infrastructure
- DeviceCheck integration
- Comprehensive security features out of the box
- Simple developer experience

<br />
### Secure Key Management

We protect your API keys using a split-key approach:
- Keys are never exposed in your mobile app
- Keys never travel over the network
- Your app only uses a project-specific identifiers
- Even if someone decompiles your app, they get at most a fragment of your provider key
- Our backend never has your full provider key without your permission
- Only partial provider keys are stored on our servers

This drastically reduces the risk of key compromise while maintaining security.

<br />
### Built-in DeviceCheck Verification

Every request through Proxed.AI includes automatic DeviceCheck verification:
- Backend verifies tokens with Apple
- No need to implement server-side logic yourself
- Requests only go through from valid iOS clients
- Zero configuration required from developers

<br />
### Additional Safety Features

Beyond basic security, we provide comprehensive protection:
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Usage tracking for monitoring
- Cost monitoring out-of-the-box
- Real-time logs and analytics
- Unusual activity detection (coming soon)
- Customizable usage limits
- Automatic cost prevention (coming soon)

<br />
### Easy Integration

From a developer's perspective, using Proxed.AI is straightforward:
1. Configure your project and endpoint
2. Replace direct API calls with Proxed.AI calls
3. Let us handle:
   - Device verification
   - Key management
   - Response formatting
   - Security best practices

<br />
### Open Source and Free During Beta

We believe in transparency and community:
- Fully open source codebase
- Free during beta period
- Self-hosting option available
- Community-driven development
- Continuous improvements

<br />
### Focus on What Matters

With Proxed.AI, you can concentrate on building great features instead of:
- Wrestling with device verification
- Managing API credentials
- Handling complicated responses
- Implementing security measures
- Building proxy infrastructure

Our goal is to make secure AI integration a solved problem for iOS developers.
