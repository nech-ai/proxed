I'm excited to announce the start of development on Proxed - an iOS Proxy API with DeviceCheck integration I'm building to solve the headaches of working with AI models.

<br />
### The Problem

As an engineer who's worked extensively with AI and iOS AI Wrappers, I've felt the pain of juggling different AI interfaces, managing API keys across apps, and constantly worriynng about how to protect my keys. The current tooling landscape is fragmented and unnecessarily complex.

<br />
### What We're Building

Proxed will be an iOS Proxy API with DeviceCheck integration where teams can:
- Handle API keys and permissions securely
- Track and optimize AI usage
- Get structured responses
<br />
### Open Source First

I believe the best tools are built in the open. Proxed's code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nech-ai/proxed), and I welcome contributions from other engineers facing similar challenges.

<br />
### Initial Focus

We're starting with the essentials:
- Core platform architecture
- DeviceCheck integration
- Structured responses

<br />
### Get Involved

If you're interested in what we're building:
- Check out the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/nech-ai/proxed)
- Follow our progress on [X](https://x.com/proxed_ai)

You can learn more about my background and vision for Proxed on our [about page](/about).
