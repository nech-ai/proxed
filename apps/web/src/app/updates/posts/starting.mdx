I'm thrilled to share the start of Proxedâ€”an iOS Proxy API with DeviceCheck integration. My goal is to solve some of the biggest headaches in working with AI models on iOS.

<br />
### The Problem

Anyone who's developed AI-driven iOS apps knows the pain of juggling multiple interfaces, managing API keys across different products, and endlessly worrying about how to protect those keys. Current tooling is fragmented and unwieldy. Developers deserve a simpler, unified approach to safely integrate AI into their mobile apps.

<br />
### What We're Building

Proxed is designed to be your secure gateway for AI calls on iOS. Core features include:
- **Secure Key Management**: Protect your API keys behind a proxy, minimising exposure within your app
- **DeviceCheck Integration**: Automatically verify genuine iOS devices, preventing illegitimate requests
- **Structured Responses**: Define schemas and get neatly validated outputs, streamlining your AI workflows
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitor usage to help manage costs and optimise performance

<br />
### Open Source First

The best tools grow from real-world collaboration and feedback. That's why Proxed is open source. You can explore the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/nech-ai/proxed) and contribute your ideas, bug reports, and pull requests. Together, we can shape a platform that meets our shared needs.

<br />
### Initial Focus

For this initial phase, I'm focusing on:
- Core Platform Architecture
- DeviceCheck Integration
- Structured Responses

As these elements stabilise, I'll expand on them to provide even more features for AI-driven apps.

<br />
### Get Involved
