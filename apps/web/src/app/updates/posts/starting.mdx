I'm excited to announce the start of development on Nech - an open-source platform I'm building to solve the headaches of working with multiple AI models.

<br />
### The Problem

As an engineer who's worked extensively with AI, I've felt the pain of juggling different AI interfaces, managing API keys across teams, and constantly rebuilding basic collaboration patterns. The current tooling landscape is fragmented and unnecessarily complex.

<br />
### What We're Building

Nech will be a unified platform where teams can:
- Use all major AI models through one interface
- Handle API keys and permissions securely
- Share context and collaborate on prompts
- Track and optimize AI usage

<br />
### Open Source First

I believe the best tools are built in the open. Nech's code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nech-ai/nech), and I welcome contributions from other engineers facing similar challenges.

<br />
### Initial Focus

We're starting with the essentials:
- Core platform architecture
- Team management and authentication
- Integration with OpenAI and Anthropic
- Basic collaboration features

<br />
### Get Involved

If you're interested in what we're building:
- Check out the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/nech-ai/nech)
- Join our [waitlist](/) for updates
- Follow our progress on [X](https://x.com/nechai_)
