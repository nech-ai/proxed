We shipped a focused update to make streaming usage complete, improve SDK compatibility, and surface richer model metadata in the dashboard.

<br />
### Streaming usage is now finalized

Streaming responses can now update execution usage **after the stream ends** so your token counts, finish reasons, and costs are complete.

What changed:

- Provider‑specific stream parsing is now consistent across OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.
- Executions now update with the final model, finish reason, and costs once the stream is done.
- Optional stream summary storage can be disabled via `STREAM_STORE_SUMMARY=false`.

<br />
### Public model list endpoints

Model list endpoints are now **public** (no auth headers required) to align with how SDKs discover available models:

- `GET /v1/openai/models`
- `GET /v1/openai/{projectId}/models`
- `GET /v1/anthropic/models`
- `GET /v1/anthropic/{projectId}/models`
- `GET /v1/google/models`
- `GET /v1/google/{projectId}/models`

These return the models supported by Proxed, along with display names and pricing metadata.

Example:

```bash
curl https://api.proxed.ai/v1/openai/{your-project-id}/models
```

<br />
### Richer execution details in the dashboard

We now surface model display names, badges, and pricing context in execution tables and detail views, plus faster model filters and selectors.

<br />
### Docs updates

We updated the docs to reflect public model lists and streaming usage finalization:

- https://docs.proxed.ai/api-reference
- https://docs.proxed.ai/authentication

If you have feedback on streaming behavior or model list compatibility, let us know on GitHub.
