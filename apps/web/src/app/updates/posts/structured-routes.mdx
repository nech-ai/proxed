# New Structured Response Routes: Text and PDF Analysis

We're excited to announce two new routes in our API: Text and PDF analysis with structured responses. These additions complement our existing Vision route, providing a comprehensive suite of AI-powered analysis tools.

## Text Analysis Route

The new `/v1/text` endpoint allows you to send text content and receive structured, schema-validated responses. This is perfect for:

- Sentiment analysis
- Topic extraction
- Text summarization
- Key phrase identification
- Custom text analysis based on your schema

Example request:
```json
POST /v1/text/<your-project-id>
Content-Type: application/json
x-ai-key: <your-api-key>

{
  "text": "Your text content here"
}
```

## PDF Analysis Route

The `/v1/pdf` endpoint enables structured analysis of PDF documents. You can send PDFs either as a URL or base64-encoded data. This is ideal for:

- Document summarization
- Information extraction
- Table and figure analysis
- Content structuring
- Custom PDF analysis based on your schema

Example request with URL:
```json
POST /v1/pdf/<your-project-id>
Content-Type: application/json
x-ai-key: <your-api-key>

{
  "pdf": "https://example.com/document.pdf"
}
```

Example request with base64:
```json
POST /v1/pdf/<your-project-id>
Content-Type: application/json
x-ai-key: <your-api-key>

{
  "pdf": "data:application/pdf;base64,..."
}
```

## Key Features

Both routes include:

- **Schema Validation**: Define your response structure in the project settings
- **Flexible Input**: Support for various input formats
- **Security**: Full DeviceCheck integration
- **Metrics Tracking**: Monitor usage, latency, and performance
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting
- **Location Awareness**: Optional geographic context for responses

## Implementation Example

Here's a Swift example showing how to use both routes:

```swift
actor ContentAnalyzer {
    let apiKey = "<your-api-key>"
    let textEndpoint = "https://api.proxed.ai/v1/text/<your-project-id>"
    let pdfEndpoint = "https://api.proxed.ai/v1/pdf/<your-project-id>"

    // Analyze text
    func analyzeText(_ text: String) async throws {
        let token = await SimpleDeviceCheck.retrieveToken()

        var request = URLRequest(url: URL(string: textEndpoint)!)
        request.httpMethod = "POST"
        request.setValue("application/json", forHTTPHeaderField: "Content-Type")
        request.setValue(apiKey, forHTTPHeaderField: "x-ai-key")
        if let token = token {
            request.setValue(token, forHTTPHeaderField: "x-device-token")
        }
        request.httpBody = try JSONEncoder().encode(["text": text])

        let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(for: request)
        let analysis = try JSONDecoder().decode(Analysis.self, from: data)
        print("Analysis:", analysis)
    }

    // Analyze PDF from URL
    func analyzePDF(url: URL) async throws {
        let token = await SimpleDeviceCheck.retrieveToken()

        var request = URLRequest(url: URL(string: pdfEndpoint)!)
        request.httpMethod = "POST"
        request.setValue("application/json", forHTTPHeaderField: "Content-Type")
        request.setValue(apiKey, forHTTPHeaderField: "x-ai-key")
        if let token = token {
            request.setValue(token, forHTTPHeaderField: "x-device-token")
        }
        request.httpBody = try JSONEncoder().encode(["pdf": url.absoluteString])

        let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(for: request)
        let analysis = try JSONDecoder().decode(Analysis.self, from: data)
        print("Analysis:", analysis)
    }
}
```

## Getting Started

1. Create a new project in the dashboard
2. Define your response schema
3. Generate an API key
4. Implement DeviceCheck security
5. Start making requests!

Check out our [documentation](https://docs.proxed.ai/structured-responses) for detailed implementation guides and best practices.

## What's Next?

We're continuously working on improving our API. Coming soon:
- More input formats
- Enhanced analysis capabilities
- Additional language support
- Advanced schema validation options

Stay tuned for more updates!
