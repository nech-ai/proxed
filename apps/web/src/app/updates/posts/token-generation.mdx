At Proxed, we've developed a unique approach to API key security that combines split-key architecture with Apple's DeviceCheck system. This ensures your API keys remain secure even if any single component is compromised.

<br />
### The Challenge

Traditional API key management approaches have several vulnerabilities:
- Complete keys stored on servers create single points of failure
- Keys exposed in mobile apps can be extracted through reverse engineering
- Difficult to track and control key usage effectively
- No way to verify legitimate device usage

<br />
### Our Solution: Multi-Layer Security

We've built a system that combines three security layers:
1. **Split-Key Architecture**: Keys are split between server and client
2. **Apple DeviceCheck**: Cryptographic verification of legitimate iOS devices
3. **Metadata Tracking**: Version control and usage monitoring

This approach ensures:
- No complete key exists in any single location
- Only genuine iOS devices can make requests
- Every key usage is tracked and auditable

<br />
### Token Structure

Our token structure is designed for security and traceability:

<br />
### How It Works

The process combines client-side key splitting with device verification:

1. **Key Splitting** (Client-Side):
   - Generate cryptographic salt (16 chars)
   - Create random split point in the key
   - Add version and metadata
   - Split key into server and client parts

2. **Device Verification** (iOS Only):
   - Generate DeviceCheck token
   - Get cryptographic validation from Apple
   - Include token with every API request

3. **Request Flow**:
   ```swift
   // Generate DeviceCheck token
   DCDevice.current.generateToken { token, error in
       guard let token = token else {
           print("DeviceCheck error: \(error?.localizedDescription ?? "unknown")")
           return
       }

       // Make API request with token and client part
       let url = URL(string: "https://api.proxed.ai/v1/structured-response")!
       var request = URLRequest(url: url)
       request.httpMethod = "POST"

       // Set required headers
       request.setValue("application/json", forHTTPHeaderField: "content-type")
       request.setValue(clientPart, forHTTPHeaderField: "x-ai-key")
       request.setValue(token.base64EncodedString(), forHTTPHeaderField: "x-device-token")
       request.setValue(projectId, forHTTPHeaderField: "x-project-id")

       // Request payload
       let payload = [...]
       request.httpBody = try? JSONSerialization.data(withJSONObject: payload)

       // Make the request
       URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: request) { data, response, error in
           if let error = error {
               print("Request error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
               return
           }

           guard let data = data,
                 let json = try? JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: data) else {
               print("Invalid response")
               return
           }

           // Handle the AI response
           print("Response: \(json)")
       }.resume()
   }
   ```

<br />
### Security Features

Our implementation includes multiple security layers:

1. **Split-Key Protection**:
   - Server part stored securely in our infrastructure
   - Client part stored on device with metadata
   - Both parts required for key reconstruction
   - Key reassembled only during request processing

2. **Device Verification**:
   - Every request requires valid DeviceCheck token
   - Tokens cryptographically signed by Apple
   - Prevents non-iOS device access
   - Automatic device validation

3. **Audit & Control**:
   - Version tracking for key rotation
   - Usage monitoring per device
   - Suspicious activity detection
   - Granular access control

<br />
### Implementation Example

Here's a real-world example of how the keys are split:

```typescript
// Original API key
sk-abc123...xyz789

// After splitting
serverPart: "sk-abc1deadbeef"              // Stored on Proxed
clientPart: "23...xyz789deadbeef.00000001000169df12345678"
                                          ^       ^        ^
                                       version timestamp splitId
```

<br />
### Getting Started

To implement this security system:
1. Create a Proxed account
2. Configure your iOS app with DeviceCheck
3. Generate and split your API keys
4. Make API calls using our SDK

We handle all the complexity of:
- Key splitting and reassembly
- Device verification
- Usage tracking
- Security monitoring

<br />
### Future Enhancements

We're actively developing:
- Automated key rotation
- Enhanced usage analytics
- Advanced threat detection
- Multi-provider key management
- Additional platform support
