# Introducing Vault: a home for generated images

Today we're launching **Vault**, a secure library for generated images. When enabled, every image produced by `/v1/image` is automatically stored in Supabase Storage and attached to its execution. You can browse everything in one place, with powerful filters and quick actions.

## Why Vault

- **Persistence by default**: keep generated images beyond the response payload.
- **Execution context**: every saved image stays linked to the execution that created it.
- **Private by design**: Vault uses a private storage bucket and team-scoped access.
- **Fast retrieval**: get short‑lived signed URLs when you need to display or download.

## How it works

1. Open your project settings.
2. Toggle **Save images to Vault**.
3. Generate images with `/v1/image` as usual.

When Vault is enabled, each image response includes a signed `url` and a stable `path` alongside the base64 payload.

## What you’ll see in the dashboard

- **Execution details** now show a grid of saved images for that run.
- The new **Vault** page shows all saved images across projects.
- Filters for **search**, **project**, and **date range** help you find what you need fast.
- Actions include **open**, **download**, and **delete**.

## Get started

Read the full guide here: [docs.proxed.ai/projects/vault](https://docs.proxed.ai/projects/vault)

If you're self‑hosting, make sure you’ve applied the latest Supabase migrations so the `vault` bucket and policies are created.
