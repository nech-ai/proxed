Working with LLMs often requires structured responses, but designing and maintaining these schemas can be challenging. We're excited to introduce our Visual Schema Builderâ€”a tool that makes designing structured LLM responses intuitive and efficient.

<br />
### Visual Schema Design

Design your LLM response structures visually:
- Drag-and-drop interface for response schema building
- Real-time validation and preview
- Instant code generation for your AI wrapper projects
- Support for complex nested response structures
- Built-in type system for reliable data extraction

### Import & Export Flexibility

Seamlessly work with existing LLM schemas:
- Import existing response schemas
- Convert JSON examples to schemas
- Import from Zod schemas
- Export ready-to-use validation code
- Export to Swift structs
- Copy schema code with one click

<br />
### Real-time Validation

Ensure your LLM responses match expectations:
- Instant validation feedback
- Type checking for response fields
- Required field validation
- Custom validation rules for LLM outputs
- Format validation for specific data types

<br />
### Code Generation

Generate validation code automatically:
- Zod schemas for runtime validation
- JSON Schema for API documentation
- Swift structs for iOS clients

<br />
### Advanced Features

Power features for complex LLM responses:
- Custom validation rules for LLM output
- Default values for missing fields
- Optional response fields
- Array validations for lists
- Nested object support for complex data
- Union types for varying responses
- Enum support for fixed options
- Description fields for documentation and LLM

<br />
### Developer Experience

Built for LLM developers:
- Keyboard shortcuts for rapid development
- Search and replace across schema
- Undo/redo support
- Schema versioning (coming soon)

<br />
### Getting Started

Start structuring your LLM responses:
1. Visit your project
2. Design your response structure
3. Export code as Swift structs
4. Use in your AI wrapper project

Transform your LLM responses from unstructured text to strongly-typed data with our Visual Schema Builder!
