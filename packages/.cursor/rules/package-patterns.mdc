# Shared Package Patterns

`packages/` contains shared libraries used by the apps. Import via `@proxed/*` and prefer each package's public `exports` entrypoints.

## Packages (current)

- `@proxed/ui`: shared UI primitives (shadcn/radix + Tailwind)
- `@proxed/supabase`: Supabase clients, queries, and generated types
- `@proxed/jobs`: Trigger.dev tasks
- `@proxed/notifications`: Novu workflows + trigger helpers
- `@proxed/mail`: React Email templates + send helpers (Resend, console)
- `@proxed/utils`: shared utilities
- `@proxed/logger`: Pino logger instance
- `@proxed/kv`: Upstash Redis helpers
- `@proxed/location`: geo/country helpers
- `@proxed/structure`: schema/structure parsing + generation
- `@proxed/analytics`: OpenPanel wrapper

## Conventions

- Apps may depend on packages; avoid app-to-app imports.
- Prefer stable public APIs: export from package `exports` and import by package name (avoid deep imports).
- Keep packages focused and dependency-light; move domain logic out of apps when it becomes shared.
