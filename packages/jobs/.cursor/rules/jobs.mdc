# `@proxed/jobs`

Trigger.dev v3 task implementations shared across the monorepo.

## Entry points

- Tasks: `packages/jobs/src/notifications/*`
- Package exports: `packages/jobs/src/index.ts`
- Trigger bridge (re-exports for Trigger build): `apps/app/jobs/*`

## Conventions

- Use `task` / `schemaTask` from `@trigger.dev/sdk/v3` and always export tasks.
- Prefer `schemaTask` with Zod schemas for typed + validated payloads.
- Use `@proxed/supabase/job` for service-role DB access inside tasks.
- Keep task code side-effect-safe (idempotent where possible) and log via Trigger's `logger`.
