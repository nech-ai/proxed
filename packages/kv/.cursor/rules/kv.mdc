# `@proxed/kv`

Thin wrapper around Upstash Redis used across the monorepo.

## Entry points

- `packages/kv/src/index.ts`

## Conventions

- Keep the API minimal and explicit; avoid leaking provider details into apps.
- Prefer typed helpers for commonly used keys/prefixes instead of ad-hoc strings.
