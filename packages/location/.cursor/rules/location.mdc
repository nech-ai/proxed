# `@proxed/location`

IP geolocation helpers and country/region metadata.

## Entry points

- `packages/location/src/client.ts`
- `packages/location/src/country-info.ts`
- `packages/location/src/regions.json`

## Conventions

- Treat `regions.json` as source data; keep changes additive and avoid breaking key formats.
- Keep APIs pure and deterministic (no network calls from this package).
- Prefer returning safe fallbacks (e.g., `"Unknown"`) rather than throwing for unmapped regions.
