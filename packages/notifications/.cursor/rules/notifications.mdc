# `@proxed/notifications`

Novu workflow definitions and trigger helpers.

## Entry points

- Workflow implementations: `packages/notifications/src/workflows/*/*`
- Trigger helpers: `packages/notifications/src/index.ts`

## Conventions

- Keep workflow payload schemas/types close to the workflow (`schemas.ts`, `types.ts`).
- Add new workflow events to the `TriggerEvents` enum and keep names stable.
- Avoid `any` for payloads when possible; prefer exported types for task callers.
