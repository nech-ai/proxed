# `@proxed/structure`

Parsers and generators used to turn user-defined schemas into typed structures (and validate outputs).

## Entry points

- Parser: `packages/structure/src/parser/*` (including `zod.ts`, `swift.ts`)
- Generator: `packages/structure/src/generator/*`
- Types: `packages/structure/src/types.ts`
- Tests: `packages/structure/src/__tests__/*`

## Conventions

- When changing parsing behavior, update/add tests in `src/__tests__` (Bun).
- Keep parser output types stable; prefer additive changes to avoid breaking callers.
- Avoid heavyweight dependencies; this package is used by runtime services.
