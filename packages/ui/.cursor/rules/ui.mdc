# `@proxed/ui`

Shared design system built on shadcn-style components (Radix UI + Tailwind).

## Entry points

- Components: `@proxed/ui/components/*` (`packages/ui/src/components/*`)
- Hooks: `@proxed/ui/hooks/*`
- Icons: `@proxed/ui/icons`
- Styles: `@proxed/ui/globals.css`

## Conventions

- Keep components accessible (Radix patterns, keyboard support, ARIA where needed).
- Prefer reusing existing primitives before adding new dependencies.
- Keep exports stable; add new components via the `exports` map and follow existing naming.
