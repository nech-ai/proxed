# `@proxed/utils`

Shared low-level utilities used across apps and packages.

## Entry points

- `packages/utils/index.ts`
- `packages/utils/lib/*`

## Conventions

- Prefer pure functions and deterministic behavior.
- Avoid env-specific values and side effects inside utilities.
- Avoid circular dependencies within `utils` (keep modules small and single-purpose).
- Add tests in `packages/utils/lib/__tests__` for non-trivial behavior.
